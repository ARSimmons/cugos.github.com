We're a group of developers, GIS specialists, designers, and geographers all gathering under one roof in the name of maps. CUGOS is the official Cascadia chapter of OSGeo. We are active in the spatial community because we believe in the power maps and data hold, and enjoy expoloring their interaction from ever perspective.

We [meet regularly](/meetings) every month and irregularly on Thursdays at different locations. If you're interested in participating in our community, please send a message to <em>hello@cugos.org</em>. CUGOS has its very IRC network hosted on [Freenode](https://freenode.net/). You can connect to our channel <strong>#cugos</strong>. If you're new to IRC, there's a [neat web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/) so you don't have to download any software.
