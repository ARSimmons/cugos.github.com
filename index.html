      <h1>What is CCUGOS?</h1>
      <p>The Cascadia chapter of the <abbr title="Open Source Geospatial Foundation">OSGeo</abbr>
	is based on a regional 
	<abbr title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</abbr> 
	<abbr title="Geographic Information Systems">GIS</abbr> user
	 group formed in 2007 called Cascadia Users of Geospatial Open Source (CUGOS). 
	 We are an active group of members who are passionate about open source software, 
	 GIS, and our region. We have members from all walks of life, a large spectrum of 
	 business and academia, and active OSGeo members (board members, charter members, 
	 and active project participants).</p>

	<h2>Usermap (Points to come!)</h2>
	<p>This map shows the location of CUGOS members throughout the region. Itâ€™s also an 
	  example of the kind of application you can easily create using only free, open 
	  source technologies!</p>

	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>CUGOS tries to maintain active Geo-Spatial projects to help engage the community, 
	  sharpen our skills, and provide unique hands on learning. Listed below are some of 
	  the currently active projects sponsored by CUGOS: </p>
	<h3 class="nevis">Roadflaw</h3>

	    http://www.roadflaw.com/map/</a>
	  </div>
	<p>The purpose of roadflaw.com is to provide Seattle, WA area residents with a web 
	  application to comment on transportation issues.Issues can be any problem from a 
	  pot hole to a bridge that needs to be constructed. The secondary purpose of this 
	  project is to provide a learning experience for technology enthusiasts to practice 
	  their skills with mapping, and web applications. This project will be built over 
	  the course of many weekends and when people feel like contributing.</p>

	<h2>Mission</h2>
	<p>The OSGeo Cascadia Chapter strives to provide support for local users of Open 
	  Source Geospatial software, and to promote the goals and projects of the Open 
	  Source Geospatial Foundation. The Chapter is focused on the Pacific Northwest 
	  region of the United States as well as Southern British Columbia. The group 
	  hosts meetings providing networking, support and educational opportunities to

	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>Started in February 2007, CUGOS has quickly grown from a core of three 
	  founders to a mailing list of over 100 active members. Loosely based on the 
	  FRUGOS group, we have held monthly meetings since inception and are active in 
	  local, regional and international FOSS GIS activities. In its second year 
	  the group has started to branch out into other activities such as hosting code 
	  sprints and actively working toward hosting a regional FOSS4G mini-conference.</p>
