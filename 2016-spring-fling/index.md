    title: "Motivations, practices, and politics of open data in Cape Town, South Africa"
    desc: "While acting as the World Design Capital in 2014, Cape Town published its first open data sets online. A number of Non-Governmental Organizations are acting as advocates and activists with code exchanges for tracking civic issues and data journalism sprints, while other organizations have been making strides to use open data as a participatory realization of open government. In Cape Town, inclusive hackathons are called “Easter Egg Hunts” are held while the public helps with open data collection through participatory mapping in informal settings. These and other exciting examples of open data in a developing world context will be shared"

    desc: "The evolution of advanced sensors and UAV technology is transforming how farmers can manage their crop health and maximize their yields. Micasense will provide a summary of the aircraft systems being used worldwide, and overview how multispectral data is collected and processed to provide valuable temporal data and crop health maps to growers"

    title: "Doing Spatial Binning Right in a Projected World"
    desc: "Spatial binning, like hexbin maps, is a great way to aggregate dense datasets.  However, non-equal area map projections present an interesting challenge, particularly for web maps using Web Mercator (which is what just about every tile map server is going to give you).   In this presentation I discuss a method for identifying “safe zones” to minimize binning problems in Web Mercator.  Don’t let bad hexbins happen to your good data"

    title: "Analyzing Geospatial Patterns Derived from Mobile Ad Bid Data"
    desc: "A variety of new technologies related to health, city planning, and commerce, etc. rely on human location data from large swaths of the population. A tempting source is location data sent from mobile phones when in-app or mobile web advertising space on the device is sent to ad exchanges for bidding. These \"bid-call\" locations have significant limitations. I will examine how geospatial patterns reveal these limitations in this presentation"

The CUGOS Spring Fling is a **full day event centered around open source geo**. This is an intensely educational learning session for passionate practitioners of all things open-source geospatial. If you care about geometry busting workflows, brain dumping academic research, parsing vertices while flying drones, code as well as content, usability through design, then show up and eat free food! Join us for this special all-day-kinda event at the magical University of Washington in Seattle.

**Location**: The fling will be hosted at the University of Washington, Forest Club Room 207 in Anderson Hall. It's the room with the elk in it. [[campus map](http://uw.edu/maps/?and)]

**Sponsors**: Want to support this event? Email [hello@cugos.org](mailto:hello@cugos.org) for information about how to get involved.

**Schedule**: In the morning we have 20 minute talks and 10 minute lightening talks. The afternoon will have a number of workshops for beginner and advanced users. While we get the schedule put together, take a look at the [2015 Spring Fling schedule](/2015-spring-fling) for a peak into what the day will look like.

**Parking**: Parking on campus is limited. Check out the [UW parking page](https://www.washington.edu/facilities/transportation/parking-daily-visitor) for more information.

**Contact**: Send us a message [hello@cugos.org](mailto:hello@cugos.org) to get in touch. Hit us up on twitter [@cugosorg](https://twitter.com/cugosorg)!
