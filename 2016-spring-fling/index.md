        title: Motivations, practices, and politics of open data in Cape Town, South Africa 
        desc: While acting as the World Design Capital in 2014, Cape Town published its first open data sets online. A number of Non-Governmental Organizations are acting as advocates and activists with code exchanges for tracking civic issues and data journalism sprints, while other organizations have been making strides to use open data as a participatory realization of open government. In Cape Town, inclusive hackathons are called “Easter Egg Hunts” are held while the public helps with open data collection through participatory mapping in informal settings. These and other exciting examples of open data in a developing world context will be shared.

        title: Analyzing Geospatial Patterns Derived from Mobile Ad Bid Data
        desc:  A variety of new technologies related to health, city planning, and commerce, etc. rely on human location data from large swaths of the population. A tempting source is location data sent from mobile phones when in-app or mobile web advertising space on the device is sent to ad exchanges for bidding. These "bid-call" locations have significant limitations. I will examine how geospatial patterns reveal these limitations in this presentation.

The CUGOS Spring Fling is a **full day event centered around open source geo**. This is an intensely educational learning session for passionate practitioners of all things open-source geospatial. If you care about geometry busting workflows, brain dumping academic research, parsing vertices while flying drones, code as well as content, usability through design, then show up and eat free food! Join us for this special all-day-kinda event at the magical University of Washington in Seattle.

**Location**: The fling will be hosted at the University of Washington, Forest Club Room 207 in Anderson Hall. It's the room with the elk in it. [[campus map](http://uw.edu/maps/?and)]
