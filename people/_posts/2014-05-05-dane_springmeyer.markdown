I live in [Winthrop, Wa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winthrop,_Washington) and work for [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com). My office is in downtown Winthrop in the [Methownet](http://www.methownet.com/contactus.html) building. If you are passing through town stop by and we'll go for a mountain bike or a swim in the river!

I'm often passing through Seattle on my way to visit the Mapbox HQ in Washington D.C and just might see you at the next CUGOS meeting.
