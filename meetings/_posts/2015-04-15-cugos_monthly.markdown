Loose agenda:
=============

- **[@you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.
- [Jacques Tardie](https://twitter.com/jqtrde) - On building **Snapsat**, a webapp that lets anyone create fullsize custom Landsat band composites in their browser. It's pretty sweet.
