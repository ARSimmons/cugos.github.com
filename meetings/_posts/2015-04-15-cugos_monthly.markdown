Loose agenda:
=============

- **[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)** - will provide an update on the [Spring Fling](http://cugos.org/2015-spring-fling/), seek feedback/input on the proposed schedule, suggest ways to get invovled and shoot fictional t-shirts from an imaginary cannon.
- **[Jacques Tardie](https://twitter.com/jqtrde)** - On building **Snapsat**, a webapp that lets anyone create fullsize custom Landsat band composites in their browser. It's pretty sweet.
- **[Fred Lott](https://github.com/flott)** - will talk about vertical datums, working with [VERTCON](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Vertcon/vertcon.html), and making a [webmap interface](https://github.com/flott/vertcon-web) for elevation adjustments.
- **[@you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.

Notes:
======

Tune in for live updates during the meeting.

[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa) is presenting from [this presentation](https://powersa.github.io/spring-fling-2015-plan/#/2). Goal for Spring Fling is to have something for everyone. Schedule right now is detailed on the [Spring Fling site](http://cugos.org/2015-spring-fling/).  Proposed tracks are:

  * Drop-N-Chop: A javascript based project for working on geoprocessing in the browser. Project page is [here](https://github.com/cugos/drop-n-chop).
  * Web Cartography with MapBox Studio, an application that lets you design maptiles with an easy to use desktop app.
  * QGIS for desktop GIS and cartography.

Ways to help:

  * Find a sponser
  * Volunteer
  * Send feedback to hello@cugos.org
  * Spread the word. Tell your friends. Tell your Grandma!

[Jacques Tardie](https://twitter.com/jqtrde) is now talking about [Snapsat](http://snapsat.org/).  A lot of cool projects involve Landsat data.  Last month Amazon started hosting Landsat8 data on S3. 

Enter Snapsat: An easy way to make a Landsat combination image/dataset. 
Snapsat process:
  1. Choose the location. Use the slippy map or do a text search.
  2. Chose what you want to make.
  3. Click a button.
  4. See your cool new image.

Use Snapsat to create near infrared images. 
Jacques is doing a pretty impressive live demo right now. Ooohs and Ahhhs all around.  If you want to volunteer on the project, Jacques will buy you a beer or coffee.

Also, checkout [Landsat-util](https://github.com/developmentseed/landsat-util), a sweet tool from MapBox. 

Fred Lott is up next
