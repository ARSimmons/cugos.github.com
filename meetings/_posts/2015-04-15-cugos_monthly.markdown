Loose agenda:
=============

- **[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa) - will provide an update on the [Spring Fling](http://cugos.org/2015-spring-fling/), seek feedback/input on the proposed schedule, suggest ways to get invovled and shoot fictional t-shirts from an imaginary cannon.
- **[Jacques Tardie](https://twitter.com/jqtrde)** - On building **Snapsat**, a webapp that lets anyone create fullsize custom Landsat band composites in their browser. It's pretty sweet.
- **[@you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.
