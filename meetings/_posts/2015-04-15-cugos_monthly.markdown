Loose agenda:
=============

- **[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)** - will provide an update on the [Spring Fling](http://cugos.org/2015-spring-fling/), seek feedback/input on the proposed schedule, suggest ways to get invovled and shoot fictional t-shirts from an imaginary cannon.
- **[Jacques Tardie](https://twitter.com/jqtrde)** - On building **Snapsat**, a webapp that lets anyone create fullsize custom Landsat band composites in their browser. It's pretty sweet.
- **[Fred Lott](https://github.com/flott)** - will talk about vertical datums, working with [VERTCON](http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Vertcon/vertcon.html), and making a [webmap interface](https://github.com/flott/vertcon-web) for elevation adjustments.
