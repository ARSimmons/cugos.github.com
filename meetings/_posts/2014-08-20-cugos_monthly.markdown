##NOTES:

###[@cliffordsnow](https://github.com/cliffordsnow)
- 10th anniversary for OpenStreetMap
- Thanks to Stamen and Tableau
- Covered everyday mapping, web mapping, cartography, humanitarian OpenStreetMap, georeferencing
- people loved the event
- Is Seattle the next location for State of the Map???
- The deadline for bids is in October, people sound interested in submitting a proposal
- initial bid, finding deals, venues, some type of social event, practical organizing on the ground

###[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)
- check out the website, edit the website
- submit issues that you find, then fix them

###[@dandevine](https://github.com/DanDevine)
- was working on a bacon app but wanted to work on a gps location game
- founded AdSpore to create massive multi-player game
- all location based
- great user response but back-end had issues that needed to be resolved
- came to CUGOS about two years ago, this his first time back but he took what he learned, and built a spatial database for the back-end to power spatial features in the app
- got into modeling geo-game engine
- Craig Miller turned him on to [XMPP](https://www.igniterealtime.org/support/articles/pubsub.jsp) for real time communication (using OpenFire)
- instant messenger server that you can plug other servers into, really flexible
- uses [JTS](http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/JTSHome.htm)
- vision: allow people to write plugins to create localized spatial game experiences

###Matt Jahn
- how accurate is accurate is mobile location on street?
- how accurate is mobile location indoors?
- Matt works for an indoor location company that's tested a lot of different indoor location solutions
- many solutions rely on in phone sensors, works best when paired with input from wireless networks in building
- coolest tech: phones utilizes magnetic field map of building to pinpoint location
- major barrier to innovation caused by hardware and software solutions that apply to small part of ecosystem

###Matt Veenstra
- works on projects in downtown Seattle that reference the Denny Regrade (removal of hill that used to be just east of Belltown)
- very few maps exist from that era
- data used by existing projects is not free
- geo-referenced historical map of Seattle from 1890s
- traced contours in QGIS, interpolated for finer elevation profile
- loaded the data into Google Earth and it looks amazing, office buildings half submerged in glacial till
