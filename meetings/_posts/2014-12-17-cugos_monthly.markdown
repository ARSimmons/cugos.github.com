##Loose agenda:
- **Hackathon** - it sounds like there is some interest in putting together a hackathon or a tutorial-based meeting. There is interest in doing some PostGIS work. We'll be in touch with more information!

- **2015 FOSS4G Seoul Stickers!** - Ryan Small just got a big box of stickers direct from Korea and he wants to share them with you!

- **[you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.
