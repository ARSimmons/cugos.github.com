## Agenda

- [Matt Stevenson](https://github.com/coregis) & [Eldan Goldenberg](https://github.com/eldang) - **How do you build a spreadsheet-powered map?**  Last fall the Sightline Institute presented us with a challenge:  build an interactive map out of a spreadsheet that is being continuously updated and edited by multiple people, includes 14 categories of data, and features popups that contain text, photos, videos, links, etc. Using a modified version of Sam Matthews' GUS, mapbox.js, HTML, and CSS, we did!
- [@powersa](https://github.com/powersa) dives into Spring Fling details and wants your help!
- **You!** Interested in helping with the website, elections, future event planning? Add yourself to [this meeting page on github](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/edit/master/meetings/_posts/2017-02-15-cugos_monthly.markdown) or hit us up at **hello@cugos.org**.
