**Location** - University of Washington, Anderson Hall, Forest Club room 207

__Loose agenda:__

- **[@svmatthews](http://github.com/svmatthews)** recaps a week of FOSS4G down in Portland and shares a story on search and rescue efforts and how organizing them spatially should be simple for anybody, not just someone who can make a map.
- **daan Strebe** presents *Map Projection as Mirror, Nostrum, Villain*. Map projections: Shine a light through a globe. What could go wrong, eh? Quite a lot, it turns out. What is a map projection, really? Why so many? For that matter, how many are there? Which is the best? How do they affect people and society? What do the cool kids do with them? And, yeah. The Mercator. Wait. What? Wait, what was Google thinking!?
- **[@erinlhamilton](https://github.com/erinlhamilton)** presents *Geoprocessing in the Web Browser*. Is it viable? What are the limitations? How does it compare to geoprocessing on the server? Who is this person? All will be answered!
