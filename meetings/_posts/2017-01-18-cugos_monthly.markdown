## Agenda

- CUGOS Board Update - newly minted officials will provide an update about their first board meeting of 2017!

- [@mapsam](https://github.com/mapsam) will walk us through the fix for [an issue on cugos.org](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/issues/176), which broke our Google Feed. This could turn into either an introduction on building a JSON API with Heroku, or how we use Jekyll/GitHub to host cugos.org - up to you! Choose your own adventure style.

- [@eldang](https://github.com/eldang) will talk briefly about some half-baked ideas to compare different regions' relative OSM coverage completeness, and ask for feedback. Could be very quick, could be a long discussion if people are interested.

- [@sarahbat](https://github.com/sarahbat) will give a short report from the National Geospatial Advisory Committee (NGAC).  Be prepared for thrilling adventures in the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), National Address Database (NAD), a new batch of committee advisory white papers (freshly approved in December!), and lots of acronyms that I'll explain.  

- [@brandonrobertz](https://github.com/brandonrobertz) will give a short presentation about his work with the New Zealand Department of Conservation and their attempts to replace an expensive & proprietary internal reporting tool with an open-source browser-based soltion.

- [@dshean](https://github.com/dshean) will provide an update on newly released and partially documented repos:
  - [pygeotools](https://github.com/dshean/pygeotools): Command-line tools and Python function libraries for raster (and some vector) geospatial data processing
  - [imview](https://github.com/dshean/imview): Simple, interactive viewer for raster geospatial data
  - [demcoreg](https://github.com/dshean/demcoreg): Tools for automated masking and aligning raster data

- You! Interested in helping with the website, elections, future event planning? Add yourself to [this meeting page on github](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com/edit/master/meetings/_posts/2017-01-18-cugos_monthly.markdown) or hit us up at <hello@cugos.org>.
