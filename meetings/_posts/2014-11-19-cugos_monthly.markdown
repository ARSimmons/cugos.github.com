##Loose agenda:
- **[Harrison Gill](http://aguaclara.cee.cornell.edu/)** - Harrison will give a short presentation on sustainable water treatment in developing countries using open design concept. Engineer team's goal was to create safe drinking water WHO standard with afforable plus low cost operating with zero patents (open source) water treatment plant. Talk covers the origins of the project and design philosophy then delve into some of the technical challenges. [Interactive data visualization](http://map.wash4all.org/)

- Mary Solbrig - Mary will speak on her master's thesis topic, Mathematical Aspect of Gerrymandering. Topic will probably be: Democrats tend to be clumped together in cities, Republicans are more spread out. Does this naturally bias elections towards the Republicans? How would we measure bias if this is true? Relies heavily on work by **[Jowei Chen and Jonathan Rodden](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/florida.pdf)**

- Jared Erickson and his 3rd grade daughter Claire will talk about Map Cubes.  We will teach you how to create them, where to find them, and how to make them from your custom maps.

- If there's time and interest [svmatthews](http://github.com/svmatthews) will **force** everybody to edit THIS cugos website and add themselves as a people on the cugos.org/people page. Bring your computer if you're interested!

- **[you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.
