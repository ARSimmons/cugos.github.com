##Loose agenda:
- **[Harrison Gill](http://aguaclara.cee.cornell.edu/)** - Harrison will give a short presentation on sustainable water treatment in developing countries using open design concept. Engineer team's goal was to create safe drinking water WHO standard with afforable plus low cost operating with zero patents (open source) water treatment plant. Talk covers the origins of the project and design philosophy then delve into some of the technical challenges. [Interactive data visualization](http://map.wash4all.org/)

- Mary Solbrig - Mary will speak on her master's thesis topic, Mathematical Aspect of Gerrymandering. Topic will probably be: Democrats tend to be clumped together in cities, Republicans are more spread out. Does this naturally bias elections towards the Republicans? How would we measure bias if this is true? Relies heavily on work by **[Jowei Chen and Jonathan Rodden](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/florida.pdf)**

- Jared Erickson and his 3rd grade daughter Claire will talk about Map Cubes.  We will teach you how to create them, where to find them, and how to make them from your custom maps.

- If there's time and interest [svmatthews](http://github.com/svmatthews) will **force** everybody to edit THIS cugos website and add themselves as a people on the cugos.org/people page. Bring your computer if you're interested!

- [aaronr](http://github.com/aaronr) will give a quick update on the "state of cugos"... i.e. banking etc.

- **[you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.

##NOTES:

- **[aaronr](http://github.com/aaronr)** non-profit/tax status is moving forward.

we switched banks, account details will not be posted here. we have a small coffer to be used for... we need to figure out how to distribute these funds.

going through first iteration of selecting officers in January or February. Aaron will drive process to elect some new people.


- **[Mary Solbrig](https://github.com/msolbrig)** Detecting Gerrymandering... Mary did a masters in mathematics, switched around a bit, wound up with a great thesis advisor.

Her advisor sugested that she go for something that people could understand, gerrymandering.

How do you tell if gerrymandering has happend? That's a core question she seeks to answer. 

Gerrymandering is a standard measurement of bias in a voting population. It's in the constitution that representation is geographic. Each congressional district has to be the same number of people.

California has 53, South Dakota has 1. So how you draw the districts has a lot of influence on who actually gets elected.

You can double the number of seats you get by gerrymandering. So if dems have 30% of population they could potentially take 60% of the districts.

You can measure bias by comparing the % of the population that favors one group with the number of seats they actually win. You look at this over time.

It's not that simple though. The distribution of the population has its own patterns that reflect political preference. Does that mean you intentionally gerrymander to make things fair?

This problem is deeply rooted in the fact that districts and represntation are spatial by design.

The naive method is not perfect because geography itself has an influence on districting.

An alternative: generate randomized districts and measure the outcome based on how people in those random districts actually voted. 

Question from the audience about how the algorithm that generates random districts affects the outcome. Mary acknowledges it is complicated. Lots of questions from audience.
