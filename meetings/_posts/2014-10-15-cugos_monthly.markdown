##Loose agenda:

- **[@svmatthews](http://github.com/svmatthews)** (or better yet! someone from Broad Street Maps) talks about a recent project with the Global Post Special Reports: [Branding Health](http://www.globalpost.com/special-reports/branding-health-public-private-partnerships-global-health#slide-1) and shares insight into building webmap applications and scaling up for high traffic.

- **[you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.

##NOTES: 

Notes are typically *live committed* during the meeting. Stay tuned!
