##Loose agenda:

- **[Broad Street Maps](http://broadstreetmaps.org)** talks about a recent project with the Global Post Special Reports: [Branding Health](http://www.globalpost.com/special-reports/branding-health-public-private-partnerships-global-health#slide-1) and shares insight into building webmap applications and scaling up for high traffic.

- **[@svmatthews](http://github.com/svmatthews)** showcases the second volume of the Atlas of Design - a collection of inspiring, beautiful cartography from around the world.

- **[@hallahan](http://github.com/hallahan)** will be talking about Vector Tiles. He will explain what they are as well as how to use them in [Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile](https://github.com/SpatialServer/Leaflet.MapboxVectorTile), a new open-source library being built at [SpatialDev](http://spatialdev.com).

- **[@powersa](https://github.com/powersa)** riffs on visualizing [path](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html) based [queues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type) and [deques](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue) in [d3.js](http://d3js.org/). We'll also dive into [path transitions](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/path/) + [interpolation](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#wiki-attrTween) for better animation.
- 
- KC cloud pilot project challenge and would like CUGOS memebers for feedbacks. (Peter, Paul & Debbie)

- **[you!](http://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com)** - we encourage anybody and everybody to participate and speak about geo-related projects they're working on or interested in.
