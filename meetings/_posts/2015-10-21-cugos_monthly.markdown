- **[@cliffordsnow](http://github.com/cliffordsnow)** State of the Map Conference Bid along with Wikipedia
- **[Julie Goldberg](https://github.com/JulieGoldberg)** will show what we've built lately in Empower Engine, including the first piece we've built with vector tiles.  I'll talk about what I've learned about vector tiles and what I'm struggling with as I try to use them for more stuff.  If time, I'll give an overview of what we're planning to build with them over the next six months. 
- **[@you](http://cugos.org/people/)** tell us about what you're trying to solve.
