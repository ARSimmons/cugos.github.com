SOTMUS Updates:

Over 800 attendees at the UN in NYC from 41 countries

It was a very professional conference. The best State of the Map that you could go to, the only thing it was missing was drones.

Lots of security

Tune in for live updates during the meeting.

Three tracks with 63 presentation, panels or lightning talks

Great Seattle representation.

Conversations have started on a joint OSM/Wikipedia conference in Seattle in 2016. Large conference 1000+. They have a lot of resources. Clifford is very enthused about the idea. He's making a call.

Videos from the conference are at their [website](www.stateofthemap.us).

Sam Matthews took really good notes at the event see them here:

Isabel focused on how maps can help community health organizations. There was a lot of representation from government bodies. There was a lot of focus on humanitarian and disaster response space. Not a lot in the development and health space. The Global Development Lab was really exciting to hear about. Their job is geo-analysis for development programming. Quality and completeness of data is a challenge across the board. Let's work to solve that. Wherever the conference is next year, you can volunteer and go for free. Which is amazing. There are a lot resources for first time contributors (mapgive.gov). The Red Cross + Spatial Dev are building Open Map Kit, which lowers barriers to contributions from the field. Really exciting way to engage/fill in the map.

Alana went to the conference to hear about projects across industries and groups. Found conversations around community really interesting. Small cities struggle to get contributors. One talk looked at contributors in these places for patterns that provide insight into the community. Alana is thinking about how she can contribute to the community in Seoul. She was surprised the conference was so international in focus. Map tag visualization tool... need a link from Alana. She saw a talk about cadmapper that users OSM data (including height). She spent a few hours trying to create 3d maps around the world. Maptime-Summit - Mostly US organizers plus a few Europeans. More and more Maptimes starting around the world. Now Alana is thinking about starting a Maptime in Seoul South Korea later this year. She got a lot of info on how to start one at the Maptime Summit.

Peter went to the conference in PDX 3 years ago, 130 people then. As a government employee, Peter was thinking about how he can integrate that data. This data is about more than just streets. This is an open data set of and for the world, empower people to grow their data. Peter can tell that this is only going to grow bigger. The trend is clear. Peter owes links to projects he thinks are great.

[Open Street Map next Saturday](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Seattle/events/223214528/) in White Center to map the area.
