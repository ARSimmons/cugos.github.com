These are not workshops! The purpose of this section is to have an experienced presenter
walk through a workflow, software demo or cookbook. People are encouraged to follow along
closely. But the presenters will have demo material up for you to follow along afterward also.

**HowTo Demos** 3 slots open ( flexible timeslots, but go long ):
