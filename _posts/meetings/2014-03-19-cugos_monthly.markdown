__Loose agenda:__

- [@aaronr](https://github.com/aaronr) will talk about recent GIS class he gave for 1-3rd graders. http://aaronr.github.io/scienceday2014
- [@svmatthews](https://github.com/svmatthews) will talk about connecting Wordpress and pretty maps (i.e. leaflet & mapbox)
- [@jdomingu](https://github.com/jdomingu) will talk about doing fun but not very useful things with [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/).
- [@cybersea](https://github.com/cybersea) and [@sudobangbang](https://github.com/thebigspoon) present the Marine Vegetation Atlas project, which is a lot of JavaScript wizardry from sudobangbang and [mkenny](https://github.com/mattmakesmaps), and not really open source, but we were invited and we like pizza.  (And it's a pretty cool project, nonetheless).
- [@cliffordsnow](https://github.com/cliffordsnow) OSM Seattle update
- [@mpgerlek](https://www.example.com/) Clipcard update!
- [@powersa](https://github.com/powersa) takes revenge on daylight savings by making a map of daylight over time
- [@pkeum](https://github.com/keum) Brief showing of realtime data display using GitHub
- [@mrosen](https://github.com/mrosen) will provide a few updates from the ESRI Dev Summit last week including (in case he forgets) including how they use GitHub, who the Key note speaker was and something about GDAL.
- Everyone ([@cugos](https://github.com/cugos)) - Let's talk about FOSS4G 2014 in PDX and WAURISA

- [@aaronr](https://github.com/aaronr) - Went over a brief run through of his presentation slides from presenting to 1-3rd graders.  Get out and get involved was the theme... go teach some kids and you will be glad you did!
  - [http://aaronr.github.io/scienceday2014/](http://aaronr.github.io/scienceday2014/)
  - Uses [Revealz](https://github.com/aaronr/revealz)

- [@svmatthews](https://github.com/svmatthews) - Wanted to integrate simple maps with Wordpress posts.  [http://mapsam.com/wordmap/](http://mapsam.com/wordmap/).  Uses Mapbox.js but can be used by any map since it is GeoJSON.  Custom Post Types, Custom Meta Box, WP_Query.  Great little example page with instructions when you scroll down.  View and submit points, even through the WP admin. 

- [@jdomingu](https://github.com/jdomingu) - Talked about investigations with [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/).  [https://github.com/jdomingu/ThreeGeoJSON](https://github.com/jdomingu/ThreeGeoJSON)  -  Killer little demo... go to the page and click the demo!

![three.js](/image/base/threejs.jpg)

- [@cybersea](https://github.com/cybersea) and [@sudobangbang](https://github.com/thebigspoon) - Washington Marine Vegetation Atlas - DNR - ESRI database + Javascript.  Step forward for DNR.  Marine vegetation provides important habitat.  Cool demo.  Lots of cool lessons learned about the hard times using some of the ESRI cloud solutions.  In order to get around many of the shortfalls forced to push much of the business logic to the client.  Leads to some slow behavior.

  - Demo of the app at [http://mva.apphb.com/index.html](http://mva.apphb.com/index.html)

- [@cliffordsnow](https://github.com/cliffordsnow) - Mapping party NE branch of Seattle library on Saturday 1pm!!!
Agenda will be to go out and map, discuss where the next one will be, and talk about gender diversity, and talk about addressing.  Ukraine issues are being discussed.  Wait until June 1st to change the map.  OSM is da bomb.  Notes - People are adding lots of notes in the different parts of Seattle... go check them out.  Craigslist is adding notes... very cool.

- [@mpgerlek](https://www.example.com/) - MPG takes the 5th.  Will give ClipCard update next month... or provide pizza!

- [@powersa](https://github.com/powersa) - Length of the day change.  Looking to show how much daylight is available at distributed points around the globe at any give time of the year. Working with D3 and showed some examples of output "so far" at http://bl.ocks.org/

- [@pkeum](https://github.com/keum) - KC CSO realtime data viewer.  CSO (combined sewer overflow).  Sewer + Storm water. 
  - [https://github.com/keum/KC_CSO_Status](https://github.com/keum/KC_CSO_Status)
  - Can view the current status at [https://github.com/keum/KC_CSO_Status/blob/master/test_file.geojson](https://github.com/keum/KC_CSO_Status/blob/master/test_file.geojson)

- [@mrosen](https://github.com/mrosen) - ESRI Dev Summit.  Github founder was Keynote.
