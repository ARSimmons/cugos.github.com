- [@svmatthews](https://github.com/svmatthews) will talk about connecting Wordpress and pretty maps (i.e. leaflet & mapbox)
- [@jdomingu](https://github.com/jdomingu) will talk about doing fun but not very useful things with [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/).
- [@cybersea](https://github.com/cybersea) and [@sudobangbang](https://github.com/thebigspoon) present the Marine Vegetation Atlas project, which is a lot of JavaScript wizardry from sudobangbang and [mkenny](https://github.com/mattmakesmaps), and not really open source, but we were invited and we like pizza.  (And it's a pretty cool project, nonetheless).

- [@mrosen](https://github.com/mrosen) will provide a few updates from the ESRI Dev Summit last week including (in case he forgets) including how they use GitHub, who the Key note speaker was and something about GDAL.
