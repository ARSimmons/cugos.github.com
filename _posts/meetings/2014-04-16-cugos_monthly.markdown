__Loose agenda:__

- [@springmeyer](https://github.com/springmeyer) will be in town fresh off a week working out of [Mapbox DC](https://www.mapbox.com) and attending [SOTM US](http://stateofthemap.us/). He will give a demo of the latest map making potential with [TileMill 2](https://github.com/mapbox/tm2) and [Vector Tiles](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9b15snlzu3r0z5o/sotm-us-2014-dc-springmeyer.pdf).
- [@sharierickson](http://www.apogeemapping.com), owner of Apogee Mapping, and her skilled "consultant" will be in town talking about her non-traditional tooling for creating [beautiful static cartographic products](http://www.apogeemapping.com/Products/index.htm) ( also known as paper maps ). In her own words and a preview of the fun to come:

> I am obsessed with maps and have always been enamored with the USGS topos due to their high level of detail, but got frustrated that they were so out-of-date and neglected.  I also grew tired of seeing most other map providers constantly regurgitating the same old USGS rasters and calling them "new" or "unique" which is what inspired me to start the amTopo line of truly original 7.5 Minute topos I started using MapServer in 2011 when amTopo was launched, and it has been amazing.  My developer wrote custom code (I think in C++) that fetches base DEM data and processes it for generation of contours and hillshading, and the same code also creates the navigational collars and legend info that appears on each map.

- The team from [@broadstreetmaps](http://broadstreetmaps.com/our-team) will talk about their start-up company, which makes maps for public health organizations and social enterprises working in development. Theyâ€™ll be introducing their visualization work, and seeking feedback on products, tools, and strategy!

- [@svmatthews](https://github.com/svmatthews) has been jammin with [@lyzidiamond](https://github.com/lyzidiamond) on a new project about mapper groups and meetups. He wants to make the project more collaborative and start pushing in more functionality by getting the good people at CUGOS to fork and help out.

- [@jradavenport](https://github.com/jradavenport) from UW who has created [24hrs of King County Metro](http://vimeo.com/88172380) will talk about how he created this data visualization video to display metro bus movement. 

- [@dshean](https://github.com/dshean) will share some large prints (and likely some slides) of annual 2 m/px WorldView Stereo DEM mosaics for West Antarctica's "weak underbelly" - an area roughly the size of New Mexico.

- [@foundatron](https://github.com/foundatron) To stream/record CUGOS meetings on Google+ Plus Hangouts...or not?  Discuss.
