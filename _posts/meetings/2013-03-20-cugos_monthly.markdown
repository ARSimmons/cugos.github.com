__Really looking forward to seeing everyone on March 20th at 6pm__

__Location - LizardTech at 1008 Western Ave, Seattle, WA 98104__ 

__Loose agenda:__

* [@aaronr](https://github.com/aaronr) has created mapfarts.com which makes it easy to drop geobombs with curl and vsistdout ( ...and more! )
* [@idbill](https://github.com/idbill) will talk about his experience cutting the world into 200 million gameboard polygons for the [Quadstreaker iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quadstreaker/id594669001?mt=8). Hopefully [@mattstevenson](http://coregis.net) can come and give feedback about his experience on the project too ( Siberia...you matter to us! )
* [@ndimiduk](https://github.com/ndimiduk) will speak about his experience porting [Census Dotmap](http://bmander.com/dotmap/index.html) to generate tiles using [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).
* [@jeff*DaMan*meyer](https://github.com/GWHAThistory) will give an update on the [St. Paddy's Day OSM JOSM training](http://www.meetup.com/OpenStreetMap-Seattle/events/107558542/) ( ...but wait, there's more! )

__Possible but not confirmed:__

* A forest-hoarding-cell-phone-wielding [@jamie](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cugos/JyUQ0pLFGMw) might show up to propose an interesting forestry-project conundrum ( UW represent! )
