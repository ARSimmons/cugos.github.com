__Loose agenda:__

- [@springmeyer](https://github.com/springmeyer) will be in town fresh off a week working out of Mapbox DC and attending [SOTM US](http://stateofthemap.us/). He'll get a talk together of some sort on the latest MapBox goodness or maybe he'll just ramble about backcountry skiing and mtn biking and how you all should come visit Winthrop. 
- [@sharierickson](http://www.apogeemapping.com), owner of Apogee Mapping, and her skilled "consultant" will be in town talking about her non-traditional tooling for creating [beautiful static cartographic products](http://www.apogeemapping.com/Products/index.htm) ( also known as paper maps ). In her own words and a preview of the fun to come:

        I am obsessed with maps and have always been enamored with the USGS topos due to their high level of detail, but got 
        frustrated that they were so out-of-date and neglected.  I also grew tired of seeing most other map providers
        constantly regurgitating the same old USGS rasters and calling them "new" or "unique" which is what inspired me to
        start the amTopo line of truly original 7.5 Minute topos
    
        I started using MapServer in 2011 when amTopo was launched, and it has been amazing.  My developer wrote custom code
        (I think in C++) that fetches base DEM data and processes it for generation of contours and hillshading, and the
        same code also creates the navigational collars and legend info that appears on each map.
