Meeting location TBD.

__Loose agenda:__

- [@springmeyer](https://github.com/springmeyer) will be in town fresh off a week working out of Mapbox DC and attending [SOTM US](http://stateofthemap.us/). He'll get a talk together of some sort on the latest MapBox goodness or maybe he'll just ramble about backcountry skiing and mtn biking and how you all should come visit Winthrop.
