Meet little after 5pm at Cafe Solstice (4116 University Way NE) and walk over there together (will start walking around 5:40pm) 

This comment came from the instructor:
"The students are looking forward to hearing about OS tools.  They have asked a few questions during the program, such as; has it become any easier to implement OS without huge development?, what skills are most needed to start using and implementing OS GIS tools?..."
