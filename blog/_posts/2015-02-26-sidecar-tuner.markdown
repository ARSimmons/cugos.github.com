On February, 26th 1985 Tina Turner won a Grammy Award for her song ["What's Love Got To Do With It"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu8KFlfzk3Y).

CUGOS will celebrate the 30th anniversary of this event by staring at our computers and listening to the song on repeat. Come one, come all -- this Thursday night ( February 26th ) at Trabant Coffee in the U-District from 6:30pm until closing. 

Bring a project to work on or an issue you want to explore/solve.
